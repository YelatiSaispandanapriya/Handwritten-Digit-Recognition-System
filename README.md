# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using a Fully Manual Neural Network.

This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** trained on the classic **MNIST dataset** using a **manually built deep neural network from scratch** — without using deep-learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The entire neural network — including **weight initialization, forward propagation, ReLU activation, softmax output, cross-entropy loss, backpropagation, mini-batch gradient descent**, and **evaluation metrics** — is implemented using **NumPy only**.
